## Declarations {#declaration}

In the Query DSL, for example, you can pass a lambda expression representing
the search criteria to the `where` function.

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where { a.addressId eq 1 }
```

We call such lambda expressions declarations.
All declarations are defined as typealias in the `org.komapper.core.dsl.expression` package.

AssignmentDeclaration
: Used with the `values` and `set` functions.

HavingDeclaration
: Used with the `having` function.

OnDeclaration
: Used with the `on` function.

WhenDeclaration
: Used with the `When` function.

WhereDeclaration
: Used with the `where` function.

These declarations are composable.

### plus {#declaration-composition-plus}

The `+` operator constructs a new declaration that executes its operands in sequence:

```kotlin
val w1: WhereDeclaration = {
    a.addressId eq 1
}
val w2: WhereDeclaration = {
    a.version eq 1
}
val w3: WhereDeclaration = w1 + w2 // Use of the `+` operator
val query: Query<List<Address>> = QueryDsl.from(a).where(w3)
val list: List<Address> = db.runQuery { query }
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ? and t0_.VERSION = ?
*/
```

The `+` operator is available in all declarations.

### and {#declaration-composition-and}

The `and` function constructs a new declaration that concatenates its receiver and argument with the AND predicate:

```kotlin
val w1: WhereDeclaration = {
    a.addressId eq 1
}
val w2: WhereDeclaration = {
    a.version eq 1
    or { a.version eq 2 }
}
val w3: WhereDeclaration = w1.and(w2) // Use of the `and` function
val query: Query<List<Address>> = QueryDsl.from(a).where(w3)
val list: List<Address> = db.runQuery { query }
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ? and (t0_.VERSION = ? or (t0_.VERSION = ?))
*/
```

The `and` function can be applied to Having, When, and Where declarations.

### or {#declaration-composition-or}

The `or` function constructs a new declaration that concatenates its receiver and argument with the OR predicate:

```kotlin
val w1: WhereDeclaration = {
    a.addressId eq 1
}
val w2: WhereDeclaration = {
    a.version eq 1
    a.street eq "STREET 1"
}
val w3: WhereDeclaration = w1.or(w2) // Use of the `or` function
val query: Query<List<Address>> = QueryDsl.from(a).where(w3)
val list: List<Address> = db.runQuery { query }
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ? or (t0_.VERSION = ? and t0_.STREET = ?)
*/
```

The `or` function can be applied to Having, When, and Where declarations.

## Comparison operators {#comparison-operator}

Comparison operators are available in the Having, On, When, and Where [Declarations]({{< relref "#declaration" >}}).

If `null` is passed as an argument to a comparison operator, the operator is not evaluated.
That is, the corresponding SQL will not be generated:

```kotlin
val nullable: Int? = null
val query = QueryDsl.from(a).where { a.addressId eq nullable }
```

Thus, when the above `query` is executed, the following SQL will be issued:

```sql
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_
```

### eq {#comparison-operator-eq}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where { a.addressId eq 1 }
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ?
*/
```

### notEq {#comparison-operator-noteq}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where { a.addressId notEq 1 }
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID <> ?
*/
```

### less {#comparison-operator-less}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where { a.addressId less 1 }
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID < ?
*/

```

### lessEq {#comparison-operator-lesseq}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where { a.addressId lessEq 1 }
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID <= ?
*/
```

### greater {#comparison-operator-greater}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where { a.addressId greater 1 }
/*

*/
```

### greaterEq {#comparison-operator-greatereq}

```

## Logical operators {#logical-operator}

Logical operators are available in the Having, On, When, and Where [Declarations]({{< relref "#declaration" >}}).

### and {#logical-operator-and}

Expressions in the declaration are implicitly concatenated using the AND operator.

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where {
    a.addressId greater 1
    a.street startsWith "S"
    a.version less 100
}
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID > ? and t0_.STREET like ? escape ? and t0_.VERSION < ?
*/
```

To explicitly concatenate expression using the AND operator, pass a lambda expression to the `and` function.

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where {
  a.addressId greater 1
  and {
    a.street startsWith "S"
    a.version less 100
  }
}
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID > ? and (t0_.STREET like ? escape ? and t0_.VERSION < ?)
*/
```

### or {#logical-operator-or}

To concatenate expressions using the OR operator, pass a lambda expression to the `or` function.

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where {
  a.addressId greater 1
  or {
    a.street startsWith "S"
    a.version less 100
  }
}
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID > ? or (t0_.STREET like ? escape ? and t0_.VERSION < ?)
*/
```

### not {#logical-operator-not}

To use the NOT operator, pass a lambda expression to the `not` function.

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).where {
    a.addressId greater 5
    not {
        a.addressId greaterEq 10
    }
}.orderBy(a.addressId)
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID > ? and not (t0_.ADDRESS_ID >= ?) order by t0_.ADDRESS_ID asc
*/
```

## Arithmetic operators {#arithmetic-operator}

The following operators are available as arithmetic operators:

- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`
- `%`

These operators are defined in `org.komapper.core.dsl.operator`.

The following is an example of using the `+` operator:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.update(a).set {
    a.version eq (a.version + 10)
}.where {
    a.addressId eq 1
}
/*
update ADDRESS as t0_ set VERSION = (t0_.VERSION + ?) where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ?
*/
```

## Mathematical functions {#mathematical-function}

The following function is available:

- random

This function is defined in `org.komapper.core.dsl.operator`.

The following is an example of using the `random` function:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).orderBy(random())
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, t0_.STREET, t0_.VERSION from ADDRESS as t0_ order by random() asc
*/
```

## String functions {#string-function}

The following functions are available as string functions:

- concat
- substring
- locate
- lower
- upper
- trim
- ltrim
- rtrim

These functions are defined in `org.komapper.core.dsl.operator`.

The following is an example of using the `concat` function:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.update(a).set {
  a.street eq (concat(concat("[", a.street), "]"))
}.where {
  a.addressId eq 1
}
/*
update ADDRESS as t0_ set STREET = (concat((concat(?, t0_.STREET)), ?)) where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ?
*/
```

## Aggregate functions {#aggregate-function}

The following functions are available as aggregate functions:

- avg
- count
- sum
- max
- min

These functions are defined in `org.komapper.core.dsl.operator`.

The expression obtained by the aggregate function call is intended to be used with the `having` or `select` function:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(e)
    .groupBy(e.departmentId)
    .having {
        count(e.employeeId) greaterEq 4L
    }
    .orderBy(e.departmentId)
    .select(e.departmentId, count(e.employeeId))
/*
select t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, count(t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID) from EMPLOYEE as t0_ group by t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID having count(t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID) >= ? order by t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID asc
*/
```

### avg {#aggregate-function-avg}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).select(avg(a.addressId))
/*
select avg(t0_.ADDRESS_ID) from ADDRESS as t0_
*/
```

### count {#aggregate-function-count}

To generate a SQL `count(*)`, call the `count` function with no arguments:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).select(count())
/*
select count(*) from ADDRESS as t0_
*/
```

It is possible to pass a metamodel property to the `count` function:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).select(count(a.street))
/*
select count(t0_.STREET) from ADDRESS as t0_
*/
```

### sum {#aggregate-function-sum}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).select(sum(a.addressId))
/*
select sum(t0_.ADDRESS_ID) from ADDRESS as t0_
*/
```

### max {#aggregate-function-max}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).select(max(a.addressId))
/*
select max(t0_.ADDRESS_ID) from ADDRESS as t0_
*/
```

### min {#aggregate-function-min}

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).select(min(a.addressId))
/*
select min(t0_.ADDRESS_ID) from ADDRESS as t0_
*/
```

val c1 = d.departmentId
val c2 = nthValue(d.departmentId, 2).over {
    orderBy(d.departmentId)
}

*/
```

## Conditional expression {#conditional-expression}

The following functions and expressions are available as conditional expressions:

- coalesce
- case

These are defined in `org.komapper.core.dsl.operator`.

### coalesce {#conditional-expression-coalesce}

The following is an example of using the `coalesce` function:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a).select(a.addressId, coalesce(a.street, literal("default")))
/*
select t0_.ADDRESS_ID, coalesce(t0_.STREET, 'default') from ADDRESS as t0_
*/
```

### CASE expressions {#case-expression}

To use a CASE expression, call the `case` function:

```kotlin
val caseExpression = case(
  When(
    {
      a.street eq "STREET 2"
      a.addressId greater 1
    },
    literal("HIT")
  )
) { literal("NO HIT") }
val list: List<Pair<String?, String?>> = db.runQuery {
  QueryDsl.from(a).where { a.addressId inList listOf(1, 2, 3) }
    .orderBy(a.addressId)
    .select(a.street, caseExpression)
}
/*
select t0_.street, case when t0_.street = ? and t0_.address_id > ? then 'HIT' else 'NO HIT' end from address as t0_ where t0_.address_id in (?, ?, ?) order by t0_.address_id asc
*/
```

## Scalar subqueries {#scalar-subquery}

A query that returns a scalar using an aggregate function is a scalar subquery.
The scalar subquery can be passed to the `select` function of another query:

```kotlin
val subquery = QueryDsl.from(e).where { d.departmentId eq e.departmentId }.select(count())
val query = QueryDsl.from(d)
    .orderBy(d.departmentId)
    .select(d.departmentName, subquery)
/*
select t0_.department_name, (select count(*) from employee as t1_ where t0_.department_id = t1_.department_id) from department as t0_ order by t0_.department_id asc
*/
```

## Literals {#literal}

To embed a value directly into SQL as a literal without binding variable, call the `literal` function.

These functions are defined in `org.komapper.core.dsl.operator`.

The `literal` function supports the following argument types:

- Boolean
- Int
- Long
- String

Here is an example of literal function usage:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.insert(a).values {
  a.addressId eq 100
  a.street eq literal("STREET 100")
  a.version eq literal(100)
}
/*
insert into ADDRESS (ADDRESS_ID, STREET, VERSION) values (?, 'STREET 100', 100)
*/
```

## User-defined expressions {#user-defined-expression}

### Custom comparison operators {#user-defined-expression-comparison-operator}

Define custom comparison operators within a class that takes 
`org.komapper.core.dsl.operator.CriteriaContext` as a constructor argument. 
The logic to generate SQL corresponding to the operator is added to CriteriaContext as a lambda function.

In the example below, the `~` and `!~` operators are defined:

```kotlin
class MyExtension(private val context: CriteriaContext) {

    infix fun <T : Any> ColumnExpression<T, String>.`~`(pattern: T?) {
        if (pattern == null) return
        val o1 = Operand.Column(this)
        val o2 = Operand.Argument(this, pattern)
        context.add {
            visit(o1)
            append(" ~ ")
            visit(o2)
        }
    }

    infix fun <T : Any> ColumnExpression<T, String>.`!~`(pattern: T?) {
        if (pattern == null) return
        val o1 = Operand.Column(this)
        val o2 = Operand.Argument(this, pattern)
        context.add {
            visit(o1)
            append(" !~ ")
            visit(o2)
        }
    }
}
```

To use the operator, call the `extension` function within declarations like Where or Having.
Specify the above constructor and a lambda expression to invoke the operator as arguments to the `extension` function.

You can use the `~` and `!~` operators in your query as follows:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(e).where {
    e.salary greaterEq BigDecimal(1000)
    extension(::MyExtension) {
        e.employeeName `~` "S"
        e.employeeName `!~` "T"
    }
}.orderBy(e.employeeName)
/*
select 
    t0_.EMPLOYEE_ID, 
    t0_.EMPLOYEE_NO, 
    t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME, 
    t0_.MANAGER_ID, 
    t0_.HIREDATE, 
    t0_.SALARY, 
    t0_.DEPARTMENT_ID, 
    t0_.ADDRESS_ID, 
    t0_.VERSION 
from 
    EMPLOYEE as t0_ 
where 
    t0_.SALARY >= ?
    t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME ~ ?
    t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME !~ ?
order by
    t0_.EMPLOYEE_NAME
*/
```

### Custom column expressions {#user-defined-expression-column-expression}

Define custom column expressions as Kotlin functions that return 
`org.komapper.core.dsl.expression.ColumnExpression`. 
You can create `ColumnExpression` by calling `org.komapper.core.dsl.operator.columnExpression`.
Pass the type of the column expression, information to uniquely identify the column expression, 
and a lambda expression to generate SQL to `columnExpression`.

In the example below, the `replace` function is defined:

```kotlin
private fun <T: Any> replace(
    expression: ColumnExpression<T, String>,
    from: T,
    to: T,
): ColumnExpression<T, String> {
    val name = "replace"
    val o1 = Operand.Column(expression)
    val o2 = Operand.Argument(expression, from)
    val o3 = Operand.Argument(expression, to)
    return columnExpression(expression, name, listOf(o1, o2, o3)) {
        append("$name(")
        visit(o1)
        append(", ")
        visit(o2)
        append(", ")
        visit(o3)
        append(")")
    }
}
```

You can use the `replace` function in your query as follows:

```kotlin
QueryDsl.from(a)
    .where { a.addressId eq 1 }
    .select(replace(a.street, "STREET", "St.")).first()
/*
select replace(t0_.STREET, ?, ?) from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ?
*/
```
